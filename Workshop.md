# $~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$ What is Spring?
The Spring Framework (Spring) is an open-source application framework that provides infrastructure support for developing Java applications. One of the most popular Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) frameworks, Spring helps developers create high performing applications using plain old Java objects 
---
---
# $~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$ Why is Spring?
### Java programs are complex and feature many heavyweight components. Heavyweight means the components are dependent on the underlying operating system (OS) for their appearance and properties.

### Spring is considered to be a secure, low-cost and flexible framework. Spring improves coding efficiency and reduces overall application development time because it is lightweight -- efficient at utilizing system resources -- and has a lot of support.
